    "  This is a simple server program that uses the poll() system call to handle multiple client connections simultaneously. Here is an explanation of the code<br><br>The code includes several header files that define socket-related functions and structures. The code defines a maximum number of clients that the server can handle, and declares several variables that will be used to keep track of the clients and their sockets. The code creates a socket using the socket() system call, and binds it to a specific address using the bind() system call. The code listens for incoming connections using the listen() system call. The code initializes a pollfd structure for the server socket, and adds it to an array of pollfd structures that will be used to track all the sockets that the server is interested in. The code enters an infinite loop that waits for activity on any of the sockets using the poll() system call.<br><br> If there is activity on the server socket, the code accepts the incoming connection using the accept() system call, and adds the new client socket to the pollfd array and the clientfds array. If there is activity on a client socket, the code reads data from the socket using the read() system call, and either echoes the data back to the client using the write() system call, or closes the socket if there was an error. If a client socket is closed, the code removes it from the pollfd array and the clientfds array, and decrements the num_clients counter. The code continues to wait for activity on the sockets until the program is terminated.\n",

    "    This code is an example of a simple TCP server using the select() function to monitor multiple client sockets for incoming data.The server sets up a socket, binds it to an IP address and port, and listens for incoming connections using the listen() function. When a client connects, the server accepts the connection using the accept() function, assigns a new file descriptor to the client socket, and adds it to an array of client file descriptors. The server then uses the select() function to wait for data to arrive on any of the client sockets.<br><br>The server uses the fd_set data type to keep track of the sockets it is interested in, and the select() function blocks until there is data available on one of the sockets. The server then loops through its list of client file descriptors to determine which client socket has received data using the FD_ISSET() macro. If data is received, the server reads it from the socket using the read() function, and sends it back to the client using the write() function. The server can handle up to 10 simultaneous clients, as defined by the MAX_CLIENTS macro. When a new client connects, the server adds the client's socket file descriptor to the clientfds array. When a client disconnects or encounters an error, the server removes the client's socket file descriptor from the clientfds array and decrements the num_clients variable.\n",

    "    This program demonstrates the usage of memory-mapped files in C. First, the necessary header files are included - stdio.h, stdlib.h, fcntl.h, sys/mman.h, and unistd.h. The macro FILE_LENGTH is defined with a hexadecimal value of 0x100, which represents the size of the file that will be created. The main function starts by declaring some variables - an integer fd for the file descriptor, and a void pointer file_memory to hold the mapped memory. Then, the file is opened for reading and writing using the open function with the O_RDWR flag and permissions set using S_IRUSR and S_IWUSR. If the file cannot be opened, the program prints an error message and exits. The size of the file is then set using the lseek function to move the file offset to FILE_LENGTH + 1 bytes from the beginning of the file, and then writing a single null byte to that position using the write function. This extends the file to FILE_LENGTH bytes in size.<br><br>Next, the file is mapped to memory using the mmap function. The first argument is the starting address for the mapping, which is set to 0 for the system to choose an appropriate address. The second argument is the length of the mapping, which is set to FILE_LENGTH. The third argument is the protection mode, which is set to PROT_WRITE to allow write access to the memory. The fourth argument is the sharing mode, which is set to MAP_SHARED to allow the mapping to be shared between multiple processes. The fifth argument is the file descriptor, which is the integer fd. The last argument is the offset in the file where the mapping should start, which is set to 0 to map the entire file. After the mapping is created, the memory can be treated as an array and accessed directly. In this program, the string \"Hello, World!\" is written to the mapped memory using the sprintf function. Finally, the memory is unmapped using the munmap function, and the file is closed using the close function.\n",
