The packet is then passed down to the transport layer, where it is passed to the appropriate protocol (TCP or UDP) for further processing. The transport layer protocol establishes an end-to-end connection between the sender and the recipient, if necessary, and segments the data into manageable chunks for transmission. The transport layer then passes the data down to the network layer, where it is encapsulated in an IP packet and transmitted to the next hop. At each hop, the router examines the destination IP address and uses its routing table to determine the next hop to which the packet should be forwarded.

These messages can be used to test the reachability of a host, report an error, or provide other information related to IP communications. For example, if a device wants to test the reachability of another device on the network, it can send an ICMP echo request message to the destination device.
