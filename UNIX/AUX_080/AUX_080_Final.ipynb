    "    Debugging and error handling can be achieved in shell scripting through the use of various built-in commands and utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "    One way to debug a shell script is to use the \"set -x\" command, which enables script tracing. This will print each command in the script to the console as it is executed, along with its arguments and any expansions. To turn off tracing, you can use the \"set +x\" command.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Another useful debugging tool is the \"bash -x\" option, which allows you to run the script with tracing enabled from the command line. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "            bash -x myscript.sh\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To handle errors in a shell script, you can use the set -e command, which causes the script to exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero exit status. This can be useful for ensuring that the script exits gracefully if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can also use the || operator to execute a command only if the previous command failed. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "            command1 || command2\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This will execute command2 only if command1 returns a non-zero exit status.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, you can use the trap command to catch signals and execute commands in response. This can be useful for cleaning up resources or taking other actions when the script is interrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        trap 'cleanup' INT\n",
    "        cleanup() {\n",
    "            # Clean up resources\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    \n",
