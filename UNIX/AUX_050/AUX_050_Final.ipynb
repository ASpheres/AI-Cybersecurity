    "    Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in the Unix/Linux operating system. It allows you to write scripts that can perform a series of commands, making it easy to automate repetitive or complex tasks. In order to get started with shell scripting, you will need a Unix/Linux system with a shell interpreter, such as bash (the Bourne Again SHell) or zsh (the Z shell). You will also need a text editor to create and edit your scripts. Installation of a Unix/Linux system is explained in AUX_080, Please make sure you have finished AUX_080 before taking this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Before you begin writing shell scripts, it's helpful to understand some basic concepts of the shell. This includes understanding the different types of shell available, how to use shell variables and expansion, and the basic syntax and control structures of the shell, such as if statements and loops (Explained in AUX_080). Once you have a basic understanding of the shell, you can start writing simple shell scripts to automate tasks. This might involve writing scripts to automate system maintenance tasks, such as backups or updates, or scripts to automate user or network management tasks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    As you become more familiar with shell scripting, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as debugging scripts, using advanced expansion and parameter manipulation, and building interactive shell menus. With these skills, you will be able to create more complex and powerful shell scripts to automate a wide range of tasks.\n",

    "    To set up a development environment for shell scripting, you will need to have a Unix/Linux system with a shell interpreter installed. The most common shell interpreters are bash (the Bourne Again SHell) and zsh (the Z shell). Most Unix/Linux systems come with one of these interpreters pre-installed, so you should already have access to a shell environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In addition to a shell interpreter, you will need a text editor to create and edit your shell scripts. There are many text editors available for Unix/Linux systems, including popular options like vim, emacs, and nano. You can use any text editor that you are comfortable with, as long as it is capable of creating and editing plain text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once you have a shell interpreter and a text editor set up, you can begin writing and testing your shell scripts. To run a shell script, you will need to make it executable using the chmod command and then run it using the name of the shell interpreter, followed by the name of the script file. For example, to run a bash script named \"myscript.sh\", you would enter the following command:\n",

    "    Good practices when writing shell scripts can help make your scripts more maintainable and reliable. Some best practices include the follwing:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and files: Using descriptive names for variables and functions makes it easier to understand the purpose of these elements when reading the script. This can be especially helpful when working on a team or when revisiting the script after a long period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "     2.  Use shell check to find and fix common shell script errors: Shell check is a tool that can analyze shell scripts and identify common mistakes and best practices. It can be a helpful resource for identifying and fixing problems in your scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Use version control to track changes to your scripts and roll back if needed: Using version control allows you to track changes to your scripts over time and revert back to previous versions if needed. This can be especially useful when working on a team or when making significant changes to a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Use functions to break up large scripts into smaller, more modular pieces: Functions allow you to break up a large script into smaller, more manageable pieces. This can make your scripts easier to read and maintain, as well as easier to test and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Avoid using global variables where possible: Global variables can make your scripts more difficult to maintain, as they can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the script. Instead, try to use local variables wherever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. Test your scripts on a variety of systems and shells to ensure compatibility: It's important to test your scripts on a variety of systems and shells to ensure that they work as expected. This can help you identify any compatibility issues that may arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. Use set -e to exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero exit status: The -e option causes the script to exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero exit status. This can be helpful for detecting and handling errors in your scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    8. Use set -u to exit immediately if any undefined variables are encountered: The -u option causes the script to exit immediately if any undefined variables are encountered. This can help you catch mistakes and ensure that your scripts are reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    9. Use set -x to print each command before it is executed, which can be helpful for debugging: The -x option causes the script to print each command before it is executed. This can be helpful for debugging, as it allows you to see what commands are being run and in what order.\n",
